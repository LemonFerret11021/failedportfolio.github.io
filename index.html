									<h2>MY Tower Defense Game</h2>
									<p>The link is to a video about it, because Im still working on it, I havent made a build that you can play yet, but I do upload<br>
									   a devlog every couple of days/weeks, so if you want, you can keep track of it there.<br>
									   My video editing skills arent that good, I am confident in my programming skills!</p>

										<h2>My Topdown Tech demo</h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/topdown demo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I made this "tech demo" to see if I can make a topdown game, as I've never done it before, and after a few hours<br>'
									   I figured it out and gave the player the ability to rotate, move, and shoot, I didnt work on it any further though,<br>
									   because I only made it to see if I can. Just like my tower defense game, I have not made a build of it but I made a video.<br>
									   (sorry about the low resolution)</p>

										<h2>My First Coding Course</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/LiveCode.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I took my First coding course when I was 12 in a coding editor called "Live Code", while the program itself isnt very good,<br>
										it gave me an understanding of how coding itself works, I made two 2D apps, one about pressing an egg to advance (a bit like those clicker games)<br>
										and the other was a quiz game that asked you rudimentary questions and added or subtracted points based on your answer, its not much,<br>
										but when I made it, I was proud.</p>
